    <h1>Bringing pets and people closer</h1>
    <p>
        Wood Green is proud to be the pet charity that makes a difference to the lives of pets and people across the UK.  Our vision is of a world where all pets are well cared for in loving homes for life. To achieve this, we not only provide care for pets in need, but also help people be the best pet owners they can be.

        <strong>We educate, advise and support</strong> pet owners so they can enjoy a mutually rewarding and happy relationship with their pets. And through our top-class facilities, welfare-friendly handling and years of experience we deliver the best quality care for every animal who needs us.
